Analyse data for upcoming trends in a particular industry.

Data comes from:
- twitter (via tweepy)
- google trends (via pytrends)
- forums (scraped)
- teaching plans

## Education
Start by looking at what adults are speaking about in the industry. Search Twitter for the education hashtag, try to identify thought leaders in the area. Generate a corpus from their tweets and track the most talked about topics by month/year. Perform a similar analysis of the blogs and teaching forums.

Look at sentiment of students talking about school, how has it changed throughout the trends.

For content changes we can analyse teaching plans.
